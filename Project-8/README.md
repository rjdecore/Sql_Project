1. **Average Selling Price** â€“ For manual, first-owner cars grouped by fuel type.  
2. **Top Mileage Cars** â€“ Top 3 models with highest average mileage (for cars with >5 seats).  
3. **Price Range Outliers** â€“ Models where price difference > $10,000.  
4. **Above Avg Price & Below Avg Mileage** â€“ Cars outperforming in price but underperforming in mileage.  
5. **Cumulative Selling Price** â€“ Running total of selling prices over years by model.  
6. **Cars Near Avg Price** â€“ Cars priced within 10% of overall average selling price.  
7. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** â€“ Trend of selling prices with a smoothing factor (0.2).  
8. **Yearly Price Drops** â€“ Cars that saw price decreases compared to previous year.  
9. **Highest Mileage by Transmission** â€“ Car with maximum mileage for each transmission type.  
10. **Top Selling Cars per Year** â€“ Average price per year for top 3 models with highest overall selling prices.

## Example Queries

**Average selling price by fuel type (Manual & First Owner):**
```sql
SELECT fuel, AVG(selling_price) AS avg_selling_price
FROM car_info
WHERE transmission = 'Manual' AND owner = 'First Owner'
GROUP BY fuel;
